# Skip-links
Skip links are links that are placed before any other content and provide a way for assistive technology users to jump to the most important sections of the page, like for instance the main content, or even jump directly to a search input on the page.

## Markup Example
```html
<skippy-links></skippy-links>
```

| ⚠️ The `<skippy-links>` element should always be the first element on the page's `body` section |
