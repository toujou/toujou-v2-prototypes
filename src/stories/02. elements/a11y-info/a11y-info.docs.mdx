# A11y-info
The a11y-info component is a non-intrusive accessibility help panel intended for keyboard and assistive technology users.
It behaves similarly to a skip link: it remains hidden visually and from mouse users but becomes visible when focused via keyboard navigation (typically by pressing Tab after the skip link).

This panel provides:
- A list of common keyboard shortcuts
- Tips for navigating the page via keyboard

It is typically placed immediately after skip links, making it easily discoverable by keyboard users.
