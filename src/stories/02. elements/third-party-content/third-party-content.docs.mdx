# &lt;toujou-third-party-content&gt;

[Docs copied from the `toujou-third-party-content` webcomponent]

This element was created as a wrapper for the different kinds of external content.

Its function is to block or show the content, according the the user's consents:
- If consent was given, the content may load
- if not, the content should not load and in it's place there should be a placeholder
with buttons to make it possible for the user to alter the consent settings

At the moment we can use the consent with video, maps and external HTML elements (for which we also have separate consents).



## `<toujou-third-party-content>` example
```html
<toujou-third-party-content contentType="video">
    <template>
        <f:render section="Video" arguments="{_all}"/>
    </template>

    <div class="third-party-content__placeholder" slot="placeholder">
        <p class="third-party-content__message">
            {f:translate(key:'LLL:EXT:toujou/Resources/Private/Language/Frontend.xlf:trackingconsent.placeholder.message')}</p>
        <div class="third-party-content__button-container">
            <button class="button button--primary third-party-content__button" ttpc-showcontentonce>{f:translate(key:'LLL:EXT:toujou/Resources/Private/Language/Frontend.xlf:trackingconsent.placeholder.button_once_text')}</button>
            <toujou-consent class="consent"
                            consentType="video"
                            consentLifetime="{themeData.trackingconsent_externals_lifetime}"
                            listenTo="click"
                            listenOn=".consent__button"
                            snackbarMessage="{videoSnackbarMessage}">
                <button class="button button--primary third-party-content__button consent__button" allowcontenttype>{f:translate(key:'LLL:EXT:toujou/Resources/Private/Language/Frontend.xlf:trackingconsent.placeholder.button_all_text')}</button>
            </toujou-consent>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!--  This is a container for some elements that need to be rendered in the Light DOM  -->
    <div class="toujou-third-party-content__templated-content"></div>

</toujou-third-party-content>
```



## `<toujou-third-party-content>` types
There are currently 3 types: 'video', 'maps' and 'html'

We define it with the `contentType` attribute, like on the example above.

The `contentType` attribute is `required`.



## `<toujou-third-party-content>` structure

The `<toujou-third-party-content>` has 3 distinct parts:
- template
- placeholder
- templated-content

#### `<toujou-third-party-content` template section
This section holds the content that we want to block / show inside a `<template>` tag.
This content will only load if there is the correct consent for it.

#### `<toujou-third-party-content>` placeholder section
The placeholder section is where we can define what is shown as placeholder.
It may have any kind of content, like texts, images, buttons,...

The placeholder section is only visible while there isn't the consent for the third-party content.

It must have the `slot="placeholder"` attribute.

#### `<toujou-third-party-content>` templated-content section
The templated-content section is `required`, and should be left empty.

It must have the class `toujou-third-party-content__templated-content`.

Any content you place inside this section will be removed during render.



## `<toujou-third-party-content>` styles
Some elements, like the contents of the placeholder section, are on the Light DOM, so they can be styled with normal css.
On the other hand, some elements can only be styled using CSS Custom Properties

| --toujou-third-party-content-display | Set `display` of the element | block |
| --toujou-third-party-content-position | Set `position` of the element | relative |

| --toujou-third-party-content-html-iframe-position | Set `position` of iframe inside the element with attribute [contenttype="html"]| relative |

Please notice that some content elements need different properties according to the content type (because of the content's own styles and requirements).
An example if the `iframe position` property for video, maps and for html elements.
