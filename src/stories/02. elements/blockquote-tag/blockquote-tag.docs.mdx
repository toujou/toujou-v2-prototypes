# &lt;blockquote&gt;

The `<blockquote>` is added when the user uses the "Blockquote" content element from the "Blockquotes" tab


## Markup example
```html
<blockquote>
    <p>This is a simple element containing a blockquote. There are no restrictions for the amount of content. So feel free to add as much information as long as it helps your story or your customer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="blockquote__author">â€“ Your Name</p>
```
