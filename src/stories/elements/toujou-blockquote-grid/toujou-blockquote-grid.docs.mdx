# &lt;toujou-blockquote-grid&gt;
The `<toujou-blockquote-grid>` is a custom element that renders a grid with `<toujou-blockquote>` elements to the page.

        <blockquote slot="quote">
            <p class="blockquote__text">Before you criticize someone, you should walk a mile in their shoes. That way when you criticize them, you are a mile away from them and you have their shoes.</p>

## Attributes
This element has a single attribute (`blockquote-grid-count`) which we can customize to set the number of columns on the grid (on mobile there is always only one column).


### blockquote-grid-count [required]
The `<toujou-blockquote>` must have the `role` attribute. It must be set to `role="figure"`.

| value | Example |
|---|:---|
| 1 | `<toujou-blockquote-grid blockquote-grid-count="1">` |
| 2 | `<toujou-blockquote-grid blockquote-grid-count="2">` |
| 3 | `<toujou-blockquote-grid blockquote-grid-count="3">` |
